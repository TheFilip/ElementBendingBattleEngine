Code for the Onyx Control Battle Engine

Avatar Legends Onyx Control is a little hobby project to keep track of generated characters. Creating stories, adjusting individual parameters, and just seeing what happens.

The Battle Engine handles combat between either individual characters or teams of multiple.


Teams can be chosen in Main file, and the match/round number in the Match Info file.



Not Included in the Repo:

- A accompaning Excel sheet of all characters and their stats. All individual stats are generated for characters, each specific for different turn options (attack, defend, observe/maneuver). Then averages of all appropriate ones dictate player stats.

- Easy to copy-paste column of generated python text of all charcter stats to generate character objects.

- Easily editable (not cleaned up sheet however)

- Ranking of all characters (of all 3 elements), by their stats.
