Code for the Onyx Control Battle Engine

Avatar Legends Onyx Control is a little hobby project to keep track of generated characters. Creating stories, adjusting individual parameters, and just seeing what happens.

The Battle Engine handles combat between either individual characters or teams of multiple.


Teams can be chosen in Main file, and the match/round number in the Match Info file.
